# Markdown_Note

My markdown notes. Just for backup and self-learning. You can view as you like, but please don't diffuse these notes. Actually I don’t think you will spread these notes due to my limited knowledge. 笔记以中英双语为主，部分纯英文，部分纯中文。

If you have any questions or anything related to my research areas, feel free to contact me.
